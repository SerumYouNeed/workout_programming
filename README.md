# Workout programming
Desktop version of workout creator. This app is the best training partner you’ll ever have. While you're focused on making gains, it handles the heavy lifting behind the scenes with the necessary calculations. It helps you track your working sets, prevents you from under- or overtraining muscle groups, and keeps your load balance in check. You can choose from a database of predefined exercises or add your own. Use one of the ready-made training splits, or create a custom routine tailored to your goals. Save your program or print it directly from the app – and you’re all set to go!

## Motivation
The gym is an important part of my life. Twenty years ago, it was simple – go to the gym and make some gains! Now, we have YouTube, Facebook, "muscle doctors," and fitness influencers lurking in every dark corner of the internet, just waiting to tell you that you’re doing it wrong! There’s always a better way! Just do (insert number) sets of (insert exercise here) and you'll be fine. Train in the morning or evening, before or after your protein shake, sleep 8 or 4 hours, do this or that... The funny thing is, the same guru can give you all this advice. To make it worse, they claim the latest research backs it up. And don't forget – it's a new day, so there’s always new research!

But I’m a reasonable person, and I don't want to waste my time on ineffective routines. So, I tried this method, that method, still watching "doctors," but the voice in the back of my head killed all the joy of training. I had enough. That’s when the idea of "Workout Programming" hit me. What if I had a tool that could calculate the necessary numbers and keep track of them for me? Maybe the pure joy of training will return...
